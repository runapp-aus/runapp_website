Real statistical problems, however, are complex and subtle. This is not a book about the theory of regression. It is a book about how to use regression to solve real problems of comparison, estimation, prediction, and causal inference. It focuses on practical issues such as sample size and missing data and a wide range of goals and techniques. It jumps right in to methods and computer code you can use fresh out of the box.\n\n\nAuthor(s):\n\nAndrew Gelman, Jennifer Hill, Aki Vehtari\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nR Markdown: The Definitive Guide\n\nThe first official book authored by the core R Markdown developers that provides a comprehensive and accurate reference to the R Markdown ecosystem. With R Markdown, you can easily create reproducible data analysis reports, presentations, dashboards, interactive applications, books, dissertations, websites, and journal articles, while enjoying the simplicity of Markdown and the great power of R and other languages.\n\n\nAuthor(s):\n\nYihui Xie, J. J. Allaire, Garrett Grolemund\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFundamentals of Data Visualization\n\nA guide to making visualizations that accurately reflect the data, tell a story, and look professional.\n\n\nAuthor(s):\n\nClaus O. Wilke\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEfficient R programming\n\nEfficient R Programming is about increasing the amount of work you can do with R in a given amount of time. It’s about both computational and programmer efficiency.\n\n\nAuthor(s):\n\nColin GillespieRobin Lovelace\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nData Science in a Box\n\nHow can we effectively and efficiently teach data science to students with little to no background in computing and statistical thinking? How can we equip them with the skills and tools for reasoning with various types of data and leave them wanting to learn more? This introductory data science course is our (working) answer to this question.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWelcome | Geocomputation with R\n\nWelcome | Geocomputation with R is for people who want to analyze, visualize and model geographic data with open source software. It is based on R, a statistical programming language that has powerful data processing, visualization, and geospatial capabilities. The book equips you with the knowledge and skills to tackle a wide range of issues manifested in geographic data, including those with scientific, societal, and environmental implications. This book will interest people from many backgrounds, especially Geographic Information Systems (GIS) users interested in applying their domain-specific knowledge in a powerful open source language for data science, and R users interested in extending their skills to handle spatial data.\n\n\nAuthor(s):\n\nRobin Lovelace, Jakub Nowosad, Jannes Muenchow\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nggplot2: Elegant Graphics for Data Analysis\n\nThis is the on-line version of work-in-progress 3rd edition of  ggplot2: elegant graphics for data analysis  published by Springer. You can learn what s changed from the 2nd edition in the Preface. \n\nWhile this book gives some details on the basics of ggplot2, its primary focus is explaining the Grammar of Graphics that ggplot2 uses, and describing the full details. It is not a cookbook, and won t necessarily help you create any specific graphic that you need. But it will help you understand the details of the underlying theory, giving you the power to tailor any plot specifically to your needs.\n\n\nAuthor(s):\n\nHadley Wickham, Danielle Navarro, and Thomas Lin Pedersen\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLet’s Git started | Happy Git and GitHub for the useR\n\nUsing Git and GitHub with R, Rstudio, and R Markdown\n\n\nAuthor(s):\n\nJenny Bryan, the STAT 545 TAs, Jim Hester\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLearning Statistics with R\n\nR book and course by Danielle Navarro aimed at psychology students\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nForecasting: Principles and Practice (2nd ed)\n\nThis textbook is intended to provide a comprehensive introduction to forecasting methods and to present enough information about each method for readers to be able to use them sensibly. We don t attempt to give a thorough discussion of the theoretical details behind each method, although the references at the end of each chapter will fill in many of those details.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nR for Data Science\n\nThis book will teach you how to do data science with R: You ll learn how to get your data into R, get it into the most useful structure, transform it, visualise it and model it.

It may also contain information (or links) with thorough descriptions of the method, but the focus here is on implementation. How can you do it in your language of choice? If there are multiple ways, how are those ways different? Is the way you used to do it outdated, or does it do something unexpected? What's the R equivalent of that command you know about in Stata or SAS, or vice versa? In short, LOST is a Rosetta Stone for statistical software.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nInteractive Tutorials for R\n\nCreate interactive tutorials using R Markdown. Use a    combination of narrative, figures, videos, exercises, and quizzes to    create self-paced tutorials for learning about R and R packages.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTranslating Stata to R\n\nThis website is for Stata users who are interested in learning R. But it could also be useful for those going the other way around. We provide side-by-side code snippets for common tasks in both Stata and R, so that users have a dictionary for navigating across the two languages.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLearn R, in R\n\nswirl teaches you R programming and data science interactively, at your own pace, and right in the R console!\n\n\nAuthor(s):\n\nNick Carchedi\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCourse Materials\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSTAT 447 : Data Science Programming Methods\n\nSTAT 447: Data Science Programming Methods is a course in the Department of Statistics at the University of Illinois.\n\nData Science Programming Methods was first offered in the Spring 2019, Fall 2019 and Fall 2020 terms as the earlier STAT 430: Topics in Applied Statistics course.

Simply fork this repo make your changes and submit a pull request.\nAll the resources in this are organised via a CSV file. When you look at this list you will not that some entries only have values in the first 4 fields:\ntype\nmetadata_available\nmetadata_n\nlink\nIn these cases the metadata_available value is “yes”. This means that all the needed metadata can be automatically downloaded via the resources web metadata. The metadata_n field indicates how much of the URL needs to be read in order to get all the needed metadata (more on this later).\nYou can test yourself if the metadata of the resource you wish to add is available using the following helper function.\nread_meta <- function(url, n = 400){\n  \n  doc <- readLines(url, n = n) |> \n    paste0(collapse = '') #|> # cleans parts of page where tag contents are across multiple rows\n  \n  nodes <- doc |>\n    read_html() |>\n    html_nodes('meta, title')\n\n  meta_prop <- nodes |>\n    map_dfr(~ tibble(property = html_attr(.x, 'property'),\n                     content = html_attr(.x, 'content'))) |>\n    filter(!is.na(property))\n    \n  meta_name <- nodes |>\n    map_dfr(~ tibble(property = html_attr(.x, 'name'),\n                     content = html_attr(.x, 'content'))) |>\n    filter(!is.na(property))\n\n  meta <- bind_rows(meta_prop, meta_name)\n\n  title <- nodes |> html_nodes(xpath = \"/html/head/title\") |> html_text()\n  title_tag <- if ('og:title' %in% meta$property) 'title' else 'og:title'\n  \n  if (length(title) > 0) {\n    meta <- meta |>\n      add_row(property = title_tag,\n              content = title)\n  }\n  \n  return(meta)\n  \n}\nJust run the function in R to get a table of available metadata. What we are looking for here are fields for a title, description and image. Usually these fields are prefixed with og: which indicates they comply with the Open Graph metadata standard. Indeed if we test the Open Graph website, we get the following:\n\n\nread_meta('https://ogp.me/', n = 100) |> knitr::kable()\n\nproperty\ncontent\nog:title\nOpen Graph protocol\nog:type\nwebsite\nog:url\nhttps://ogp.me/\nog:image\nhttps://ogp.me/logo.png\nog:image:type\nimage/png\nog:image:width\n300\nog:image:height\n300\nog:image:alt\nThe Open Graph logo\nog:description\nThe Open Graph protocol enables any web page to become a rich object in a social graph.\nfb:app_id\n115190258555800\ndescription\nThe Open Graph protocol enables any web page to become a rich object in a social graph.\ntitle\nThe Open Graph protocol\n\nIf you get a complete metadata record simply add the details to the first three fields, including metadata_available as “yes” and metadata_n as “100”. The metadata_n field is needed in order to limit the amount of each webpage that is read; remember we are only after the metadata and this is generally found in the first 100 rows. Increment n by 100 until you get something. You can see exactly where the metadata is by inspecting the resources code.\n\nWhere a resources metadata does not include a title, description and image; please add these additional fields to the CSV and set metadata_available value as “no”.\nAnd that’s it. You have added a new R resource to the list.\n\n\n\n",

      "contents": "\nThe terms of reference below have been proposed but not yet formally adopted by runapp\nObjective\nThe objective of this document is to set out the purpose for the founding of the R Users Network of Australian Public Policy (runapp) and lays out its intended objectives as a guide to the committee and the membership.\nPurpose of the group\nData analysis is becoming increasingly important in public policy and the public sector. R is a key tool used for data analysis. But, for a number of years, the R user community in public policy has operated in isolation. There are a number of R groups within bigger organisations (such as the PC and RBA) but their presence across the board has been small and limited. There are immense benefits to community R organisations as has been seen in the success of R user groups such as R-Ladies, ropensci and ozunconf.\nUnderpinned by the appreciation of open source tools, these groups and organisations are aimed at fostering a deeper understanding of R and building a community of users who might give back. It is with this ethos that the group was created. \nrunapp supports an inclusive and vibrant community of R users working in public policy and the public sector by curating resources for using R effectively; developing and maintaining packages for common tasks; and supporting more efficient and reproducible data analysis in public policy.\nWe do this by encouraging the take-up of R by people working in Australian public policy and the public sector through:\nCreating R resources that are relevant to both the tasks commonly undertaken by policy and public sector analysts, including resources that are specific to the use of Australian data;\nHosting workshops, seminars and other events to spread information about the use of R and for sharing tips and tricks;\nProviding a forum for code reviews, technical discussions, and advice for those who might not work in an organisation with many R coders or technical colleagues;\nIdentifying and developing packages that will be useful for users; and\nMaintaining a website and other communications channels like Slack to encourage communication among members about how to solve common R problems and common problems encountered when conducting data analysis in the public sector in Australia.\n\n\n\n",
